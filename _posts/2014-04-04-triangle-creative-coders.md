## Introducing Triangle Creative Coders

Triangle Creative Coders is a group of creative coding enthusiasts based in Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill, North Carolina. We focus on creative coding and hacking in the visual and audio arts, using tools such as [Processing](http://www.processing.org), [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.org), [Cinder](http://www.libcinder.org), Javascript, [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/), [Max](http://cycling74.com/products/max/), and more. 

We are in the process or organizing our first meeting and will post details when they are available. The current target date is the 14th of May, 2014, at the [James B. Hunt Library at North Carolina State University](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/huntlibrary).
