## Template for 270 degree screen at Hunt Library

The [Teaching and Visualization Lab](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/spaces/teaching-and-visualization-lab) ([specs](https://magnolia.lib.ncsu.edu/tech_specs/?room=tv)) at [Hunt Library](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/huntlibrary) at NCSU has a Windows server with 270 degree projection capabilities. In the future, we may be able to install desired software onto it. For now, however, it definitely has [Processing](http://processing.org/), which can take advantage of the entire screen. To facilitate use of the 270 degree capabilities, we create a [sketch](https://github.com/tricoders/vizlab) that has the proper dimensions of the screen (scaled down via a variable you can change) and includes vertical lines where the breaks in the screen are. You can find it here in a repository:
